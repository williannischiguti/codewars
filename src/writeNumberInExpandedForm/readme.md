<h1>Write Number in Expanded Form</h1>
You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form. For example:

Kata.expandedForm(12); # Should return "10 + 2"
Kata.expandedForm(42); # Should return "40 + 2"
Kata.expandedForm(70304); # Should return "70000 + 300 + 4"
NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.
